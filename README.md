# Hand-Gesture-Recognition---Finger-Counting
This project uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to recognize hand gestures and count the number of fingers raised in real time using a webcam. The program detects hands, identifies key landmarks, and determines the number of extended fingers based on their positions.
